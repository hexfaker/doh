Docker-based development environments. Think of it like conda envs or virtual envs on steroids.
</div> 

## Features

- Launch docker containers with strong defaults for interactive usage
  - workdir mounted by default
  - files created inside docker have correct ownership
  - dirs mounted and env vars set can be configured
  - Selected files from home dir can be propagated to fake home inside docker
- Run ssh server for remote development in containers without image modification, with docker on remote host support
- Launch jupyter kernels inside docker (either with vscode ssh development or with external jupyter server)

## Quick start
1) Ensure your python is at least 3.8
2) Install doh:
   * With [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) (preferred, dependencies for cli tools installed with pipx are managed independently):
    ```shell
    pipx install 'git+https://github.com/hexfaker/doh.git'
    ```
   * To your existing virtualenv (your dependencies may conflict with doh's):
    ```shell
    pip install 'git+https://github.com/hexfaker/doh.git'
    ```
3) Cd into your project dir:
  ```shell
  mkdir -p my-simple-torch-project && cd my-simple-torch-project
  ```
3) Create `Dockerfile` in it
```dockerfile
# my-simple-torch-project/Dockerfile
FROM pytorch/pytorch:1.7.0-cuda11.0-cudnn8-devel
```
4) Create to-go doh config
```shell
doh init
```
5) Enjoy
```shell
doh sh # Spawns a shell inside container
doh ssh # Starts ssh server inside container, follow instructions to connect
doh kernel-install # Writes some configs for jupyterlab(notebook) that allows to run kernel inside container. Requires python and ipython to be present inside container
doh exec # For advanced usage, runs a single command inside container
```
